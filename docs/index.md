## What it does

This program will help you decode scantrons and produce comparison reports against an answer key, if provided.

## How it works

The program accepts image uploads of scantrons and carries out a series of image post-processing before feeding the file into OpenCV for results capture.  Images of type answerkey can be uploaded and then tagged to subsequent response images to generate a diff report between the two captures.
